# About Me
I am a Ph.D. student major in Business, Management at [Aubrun University](https://www.auburn.edu/). I completed my Phd's degree in Business Administration
from [Jilin University)](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/), and obtained my bachelorâ€™s and master's degree from [Jilin University)](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/).

I earned my Ph.D. from the School of Business and Management at Jilin University, where I was advised by Dr. Li Cai. My research interests encompass entrepreneurial opportunity, entrepreneurial cognition, entrepreneurial ecosystems, and innovation-driven entrepreneurship. Specifically, my work investigates the ontology of entrepreneurial opportunity, the development of opportunities, and factors that affect the transformation of new venture ideas into entrepreneurial actions.

My experience as a visiting scholar at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte [UNCC](https://www.charlotte.edu/)  profoundly shaped my research interests. Working with Dr. [Franz W. Kellermanns](https://belkcollege.charlotte.edu/directory/franz-w-kellermanns/) exposed me to cutting-edge theories and methodologies in entrepreneurship, solidifying my desire to conduct research in a stimulating, globally connected academic environment.
