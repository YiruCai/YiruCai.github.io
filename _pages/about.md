# About Me
I am a Ph.D. student major in Business, Management at [Aubrun University](https://www.auburn.edu/). I completed my Phd's degree in Business Administration
from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/), and obtained my bachelorâ€™s from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/).

I earned my Ph.D. from the School of Business and Management at Jilin University, where I was advised by Dr. Li Cai. My research interests encompass entrepreneurial opportunity, entrepreneurial cognition, entrepreneurial ecosystems, and innovation-driven entrepreneurship. Specifically, my work investigates the ontology of entrepreneurial opportunity, the development of opportunities, and factors that affect the transformation of new venture ideas into entrepreneurial actions.

From November 2021 to June 2023, I had the privilege of studying at the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte](https://www.charlotte.edu/), under the guidance of Dr. [Franz W. Kellermanns](https://belkcollege.charlotte.edu/directory/franz-w-kellermanns/). During this period, I immersed myself in examining the holistic view of entrepreneurial opportunity, specifically focusing on how entrepreneurs' skills influence opportunity evaluation and subsequent entrepreneurial action across the distinct contexts of discovery, creation, and ambidexterity. My research also delved into the comparative differences between Chinese and U.S. entrepreneurs, further enriching my understanding of entrepreneurial dynamics in diverse cultural settings. This is my [CV](yiru_cv.pdf)
