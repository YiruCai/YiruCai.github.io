# About Me
I am a Ph.D. student major in Business, Management at [Aubrun University](https://www.auburn.edu/). I completed my Phd's degree in Business Administration
from [Jilin University)](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/), and obtained my bachelor‚Äôs and master's degree from [Jilin University)](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/).

Yiru Cai earned her Ph.D. from the School of Business and Management at Jilin University, where she was advised by Dr. Li Cai. Her
research interests encompass entrepreneurial opportunity, entrepreneurial cognition, entrepreneurial ecosystems, and innovation‚Äëdriven
entrepreneurship. Specifically, her work investigates the ontology of entrepreneurial opportunity, the development of opportunities, and
factors that affect the transformation of new venture ideas into entrepreneurial actions.
