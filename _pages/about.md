# About Me
I am a Ph.D. student major in Business, Management at [Aubrun University](https://www.auburn.edu/). I completed my Phd's degree in Business Administration
from [Jilin University)](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/), and obtained my bachelorâ€™s and master's degree from [Jilin University)](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/).

I earned my Ph.D. from the School of Business and Management at Jilin University, where I was advised by Dr. Li Cai. My research interests encompass entrepreneurial opportunity, entrepreneurial cognition, entrepreneurial ecosystems, and innovation-driven entrepreneurship. Specifically, my work investigates the ontology of entrepreneurial opportunity, the development of opportunities, and factors that affect the transformation of new venture ideas into entrepreneurial actions.
